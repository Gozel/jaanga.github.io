Jaanga ~ Read Me
================
## Concept
Jaanga is the home of a variety of 3D visualization apps that are generally based around the [Three.js]( http://threejs.org ) JavaScript 3D library - a collection of tools that greatly simplifies access to [WebGL]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL ) API. 


## Project Links

You have two ways of viewing the Jaanga files on GitHub:  

* As web pages hosted on GitHub: [jaanga.github.io]( http://jaanga.github.io/ "view the files as apps." )  <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  
* As source code on GitHub: [github.com/jaanga]( https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/ "View the files as source code." )  <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>


## Notes


Everything here is [free and open source software]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software 'free as in beer and free as in money' ).

All the source code for the apps is hosted and accessible via GitHub in public repositories.

Jaanga is a [GitHub Organization]( https://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations ) - which means that anybody may join and contribute.

The objective is that all the apps here should be useful to non-technical people and to entry-level programmers.

The intention is that all the apps run via an API and that simple tools are available to get going.

This repository is dedicated to [John Tukey]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey ) for his vision in describing exploratory data analysis.
