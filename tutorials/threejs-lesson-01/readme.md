## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Patttern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

-->

Learning how to program is an educational process. As with most educational processes, the task is to open up your mind to new ways of thinking.
The processes may take a long time, have many false directions and much may end up not be that useful.
 
### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

To create a just-in-time learning system, where you learn just enough to get some useful things done.


### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->


## Things to Try

* Copy and paste the code for one of the boxes and use the code to add a new box in a new position
* Add more boxes in more places, in more sizes with varying rotation
* Add your name to the title of the lesson
	* Change the text size to 24 point text
* Make the sizes of the grid and axis indicator much larger and different from each other
* Move the initial camera position so that you look almost straight down or from the side


## Features

* Rotate, Zoom and Pan
	* 1 finger / left button =  rotate
	* 2 finger / wheel = zoom in and out
	* 3 finger / right button = pan

## Issues / Things to note

* Three.js inserts objects using the center point of the object - not using a corner as most CAD apps do
* Three.js uses traditional computer graphics XYZ - the Z comes out of the screen and the Y points up
