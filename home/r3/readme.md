## Concept
<a href="http://jaanga.github.io" target="_blank">Jaanga.github.io</a> is a GitHub organization
with source code at <a href="https://github.com/jaanga" target="_blank">github.com/jaanga</a>.

The name 'Jaanga' was chosen because it sounds jazzy, it is short and search results indicate uniqueness.

There is a good amount of FOSS available here - including the following projects:

* <a href="http://atechathon.github.io/" target="_blank">aTechathon</a> ~ the current 'hottie'.
<a href="https://github.com/aTechathon/atechathon.github.io" target="_blank">Source</a>.

* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/terrain/" target="_blank">Jaanga Terrain</a> ~ The data for the altitude above sea level of everywhere on earth to a resolution of 90 meters supplied as PNG heightmaps.
Also supplied are demo apps with source to view Jaanga Terrain data in 3D.
<a href="https://github.com/jaanga/terrain" target="_blank">Source</a>.

* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/" target="_blank">Gestification</a> ~ work that involves Three.js and the Leap Motion device.
<a href="https://github.com/jaanga/gestification" target="_blank">Source</a>.

* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/algesurf" target="_blank">algeSurf</a> ~ mathematics with a 3D perspective.
<a href="https://github.com/jaanga/algesurf" target="_blank">Source</a>.

* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/urdacha" target="_blank">Urdacha</a> ~ entry for the Swiss Center _Urban Data Challenge_.
<a href="https://github.com/jaanga/urdacha" target="_blank">Source</a>.

* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/brainofrichard/" target="_blank">The Brain of Richard</a> ~ 3D compilations of hundreds of 2D scanned MRI images.
<a href="https://github.com/jaanga/brainofrichard/tree/gh-pages" target="_blank">Source</a>.

* <a href="https://github.com/jaanga/cookbook" target="_blank">Cookbook</a> ~ various and sundry code cookbook projects and files used for presentations or in blog posts.


## Project Links
<!--
You have two ways of viewing the Jaanga files:

* Code hosted on GitHub: [jaanga.github.io]( http://jaanga.github.io/ "view the files as apps." )
* Source code on GitHub: [github.com/jaanga]( https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/ "View the files as source code." )
-->

Jaanga is a [GitHub]( http://github.com) [organization account]( https://help.github.com/articles/what-s-the-difference-between-user-and-organization-accounts ) and has multiple owners and admins. 
All Jaanga scripts are [FOSS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ).
Scripts are hosted on GitHub and are viewable as web apps, as described in the 'Read Me' files and as source code.

The three ways of looking at the Jaanga scripts:

1. [Live Demo (same as above)]( http://atechathon.github.io/simplitechture/simplitechture-05-nerbous.html )  
2. [Read Me]( http://jaanga.github.io/ "view the files as apps." ) <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >   
3. [Source Code]( https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/ "View the files as source code." ) <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>  

## System Requirements

In order to view the files on this site you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/)
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the apps on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.
 
The apps here are currently being built and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such time as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.



## Copyright and License
