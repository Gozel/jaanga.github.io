## Concept
<a href="http://jaanga.github.io" target="_blank">Jaanga.github.io</a> is a GitHub organization
with source code at <a href="https://github.com/jaanga" target="_blank">github.com/jaanga</a>.

The name 'Jaanga' was chosen because it sounds jazzy, it is short and search results indicate uniqueness.

There is a good amount of FOSS available here - including the following projects:

* <a href="http://jaanga.github.com/cookbook" >Cookbook</a> ~ various and sundry code cookbook projects and files used for presentations or in blog posts.
	* Most recent work has been here

* [SP500]( http://jaanga.github.io/sp500/index.html )

* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/algesurf" >algeSurf</a> ~ mathematics with a 3D perspective.

* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-r2/terrain.html" >Terrain</a> ~ In the mist of a complete reconstruction

<!--

* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/terrain/" >Terrain Data</a> ~ The data for the altitude above sea level of everywhere on earth to a resolution of 90 meters supplied as PNG heightmaps.

* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-viewer/" >Terrain Viewer</a> ~ Three quite different ways of viewing the Terrain Data

* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-viewer/" >Terrain Plus</a> ~ Gazetteers and other mapping extras
-->

* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/" >Gestification</a> ~ work that involves Three.js and the Leap Motion device.

* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/urdacha" >Urdacha</a> ~ entry for the Swiss Center _Urban Data Challenge_.

* <a href="http://jaanga.github.io/brainofrichard/" >The Brain of Richard</a> ~ 3D compilations of hundreds of 2D scanned MRI images.


## Project Links

Jaanga is a [GitHub]( http://github.com) [organization account]( https://help.github.com/articles/what-s-the-difference-between-user-and-organization-accounts ) and has multiple owners and admins. 
All Jaanga scripts are [FOSS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ).


## System Requirements

In order to view the files on this site you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/)
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the apps on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.
 
The apps here are currently being built and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such time as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.
