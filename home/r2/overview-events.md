Jaanga Events Overview
======================

What the Events home page looks like:	
<iframe src="http://jaanga.github.io/events/" width=100% height=500px></iframe>
There is an `iframe` here. It is not visible when viewed on github.com/jaanga. To view, please go to jaanga.github.io.	
## Concept
Code prepared for an event, as a one-off probably to help somebody or to respond to a specific query, or work that has been superseded such as fun home page graphics.
