## Concept

[Jaanga.github.io]( http://jaanga.github.io ) is a [GitHub]( http://github.com ) [organization]( https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/tree/master/home/r4 )
with source code at [github.com/jaanga]( http://github.com/jaanga ).

The name 'Jaanga' was chosen because it sounds jazzy, it is short and search results indicate uniqueness.
This is because Jaanga is about writing software that is fun, easy and gets things done.

### Mission  
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->
* To supply scripts that are useful, written in code that is simple to understand
* To help people get into science, technology, engineering and math ([STEM]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_Technology,_Engineering,_and_Mathematics ) )
* To help designers, engineers, scientists - non-programmers - create new types of domain-specific apps
* To utilize the new technologies being made available in browsers to create new visual and aural interactions
* To supply all code as free open source software( [FOSS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ) )
* To visualize everything in 3D

### Vision  
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* So much of what people do is informed by the tradition of paper. Let's disrupt some of those notions

## System Requirements

In order to view the files on this site you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/).
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the apps on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.
 
The apps here are currently being built and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such time as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.
