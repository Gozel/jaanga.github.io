_A 3D Model file viewer_

***

## Features

* Loads 3D Models and displays them in your browser
* Load by drag and drop or by file open dialog box
* Scale, rotate and position each model
* Currently all models have their material changed to gray
* Support all the file formats supported by the [Three.js Editor]( http://threejs.org/editor/ )
* Supported file formats include the following:
	* amf
	* awd
	* babylon
	* babylonmeshdata
	* ctm
	* dae
	* fbx
	* js
	* json

## Issues

* Not all formats have 100% success. Hello .dae and .kmz files, we are looking at you
* Current release attempts to rescale objects in a 'zoom-all' fashion - has many issues

## Road Map

* Add materials
* Add changing colors
* Add location.hash support
* Improve auto object scaling feature
* Save data to new JSON file.
* Add gltf file format
