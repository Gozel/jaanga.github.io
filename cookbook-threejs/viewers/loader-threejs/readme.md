## Full screen: [Loader Three.JS ]( http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook-threejs/viewers/loader-threejs/ )

_A 3D Model file viewer_

***
## Mission

* To help the code in Loader.js from the Three.js Editor be available for a broad range of uses while remaining at a beginner level of coding complexity
  
## Features

* Loads 3D Models and displays them in your browser
* Load by drag and drop or by file open dialog box
* Scale, rotate and position each model
* Currently all models have their material changed to gray
* Support all the file formats supported by the [Three.js Editor]( http://threejs.org/editor/ )
* Supported file formats include the following:
	* amf
	* awd
	* babylon
	* babylonmeshdata
	* ctm
	* dae
	* fbx
	* js
	* json
	* 3geo
	* 3mat
	* 3obj
	* 3scn
	* kmz
	* md2
	* obj
	* playcanvas
	* ply
	* stl
	* vtk
	* wrl

## Issues

* Not all formats have 100% success. Hello .dae and .kmz files, we are looking at you
* Current release attempts to rescale objects in a 'zoom-all' fashion - has many issues

## Road Map

* Add materials
* Add changing colors
* Add location.hash support
* Improve auto object scaling feature
* Save data to new JSON file.
* Add gltf file format
 
## Credits and Background

Loader Three.js is based on the Loader.js file from the [Three.js Editor]( http://threejs.org/editor/ ).
The challenge is to make as few edits as possible - so that any improvements to Loader.js may be quickly and easily adapted to this effort.
