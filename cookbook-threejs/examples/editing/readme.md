## [Fillet Line Array R3]( http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook-threejs/examples/editing/fillet-line-array/fillet-line-array-r3.html )

The mission is to help the peeps at OpenDesk transfer data fron their SketchUp files over to Three,js.

Currently they are creating humongous Three.js JSON files using Python.

The concept here is

Given a .CSV file or Google Spreadsheet or parametric data is some format that contains points that form a polygon and fillet radii for each point, 
create Three.js path that can extrude to a 3D shape.

Allow for both convex and concave curves / inside and outside fillets.



## To Do



## Issues

Handles the angles incorrectly when adjacent fillets are of different radii.
