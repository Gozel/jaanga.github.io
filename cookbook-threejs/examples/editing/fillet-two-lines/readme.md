_Fillet Two Lines_

***

## Concept

_2016-06-09 ~ A work in progress - getting there..._

A precursor to [Fillet Line Array]( http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook-threejs/examples/editing/fillet-line-array/ ) 

### Mission

* Draw a 3D shape indicating the [fillet]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillet_(mechanics) ) of specified radius between two co-planar lines


### Vision

* Make it easy to add curved corners to lots of things 


## Features

* Draws lines, segment and shape
* Sliders allow you to adjust the angles and see results in real-time
* Determines if the angle between two lines is convex, concave or straight
* Readout identifies if the angle is convex or concave
* Finds and displays maker at center of fillet
* Finds and displays fillet and edge tangent points
* The 3D views below enable you to rotate and pan using one, two or three fingers or left button, scroll wheel and right buttons on your pointing device. 
* Click three bars( 'hamburger' ) icon to slide menu in or out



## Things you can do using this script

* Use one/two/three fingers to rotate/zoom/pan the display in 3D
	* Or left/scroll/right with your pointing device 
* Click the three bars( 'hamburger menu icon' ) to slide the menu in and out
* Press Control-U/Command-Option-U to view the source code
* Press Control-Shift-J/Command-Option-J to see if the JavaScript console reports any errors



## Things you can do by editing the code

* Open this file: https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/tree/master/cookbook-threejs/examples/editing/fillet-two-lines/
* Click the 'Raw' icon and save the raw file to your computer
* Once you've downloaded the file, you can click it to run it.
* Open the file with a text editor

## Change Log


### 2016-06-09 R3

* Update read me
* Add and display offset lines at fillet radius distance
* Add and display marker at intersection point of the two offsets
* Add and display markers at fillet and line intersections 
* Code streamline - a lot

Nice gentle progress. 

Being able to visualize diffs in real-time using things like sliders really helps with debugging.
 
### 2016-06-08 R2.1

* Add 3D geometry
* update readme



### 2016-06-06

* Add Read Me
