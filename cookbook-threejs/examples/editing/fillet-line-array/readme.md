_Fillet Line Array_

## Concept
The mission is to help the peeps at [OpenDesk]( https://www.opendesk.cc/ ) transfer data from their SketchUp files over to Three,js.

Currently they are creating humongous Three.js JSON files using Python.

The concept here is:

Given a .CSV file or Google Spreadsheet or parametric data in some format that contains points that form a polygon and fillet radii for each point, 
create Three.js path that can extrude to a 3D shape.

Allow for both convex and concave curves / inside and outside fillets.


## Features

* Display multiple examples by clicking buttons
* Displays angle calculations
* The 3D views below enable you to rotate and pan using one, two or three fingers or left button, scroll wheel and right buttons on your pointing device. 
* Click three bars( 'hamburger' ) icon to slide menu in or out
* Display mesh as solid or wireframe
* Direct link to this read me file
* Click on title to reload 


## Things you can do using this script

* Use one/two/three fingers to rotate/zoom/pan the display in 3D
	* Or left/scroll/right with your pointing device 
* Click the three bars( 'hamburger menu icon' ) to slide the menu in and out
* Press Control-U/Command-Option-U to view the source code
* Press Control-Shift-J/Command-Option-J to see if the JavaScript console reports any errors


## Things you can do by editing the code

* Open the latest file here: https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/tree/master/cookbook-threejs/examples/editing/fillet-line-array/
* Click the 'Raw' icon and save the raw file to your computer
* Once you've downloaded the file, you can click it to run it.
* Open the file with a text editor

## Wish list

* Handle variable fillet radii
* Centers and radii from a GitHub Gist
* Use shape.fromPoints( obj.path ) to reduce number of faces

## Issues

* Handles the angles incorrectly when adjacent fillets are of different radii.
