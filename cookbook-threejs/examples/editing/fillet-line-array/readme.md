_Fillet Line Array_

## Concept

### Mission

The mission is to help the peeps at [OpenDesk]( https://www.opendesk.cc/ ) transfer data from their SketchUp files over to Three,js.

Currently they are creating humongous Three.js JSON files using Python.

The concept here is:

Given a .CSV file or Google Spreadsheet or parametric data in some format that contains points that form a polygon and fillet radii for each point, 
create Three.js path that extrudes to a Three.js 3D shape.

Allow for both convex and concave curves / inside and outside fillets.

Allow for polygonal holes

### Vision

* To make the design and creation of CNC cutouts as easy as slicing a pie


## Features

* Handles arbitrary number of vertices
* Handles variable fillet radii
* Display multiple examples by clicking buttons
* Displays angle calculations including convexity
* Creates Three.js extruded shape
* Display a variety of construction lines and center points

## Things you can do using this script

* Use one/two/three fingers to rotate/zoom/pan the display in 3D
	* Or left/scroll/right with your pointing device 
* Click the three bars( 'hamburger menu icon' ) to slide the menu in and out
* Click the check box to display mesh as solid or wireframe
* Click the 'I' in the circle to go to the read me file
* Click on the title to reload the script
* Press Control-U/Command-Option-U to view the source code
* Press Control-Shift-J/Command-Option-J to see if the JavaScript console reports any errors


## Things you can do by editing the code

* Open the latest file here: https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/tree/master/cookbook-threejs/examples/editing/fillet-line-array/
* Click the 'Raw' icon and save the raw file to your computer
* Once you've downloaded the file, you can click it to run it.
* Open the file with a text editor


## Wish list

* Centers and radii from a GitHub Gist
* Handle polygons with polygonal holes


## Issues

* If the fillets overlap curious examples may be created

Intended for OpenDesk/WikiHouse...
