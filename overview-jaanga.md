## Concept
This is your 3D happy-place. Click the menu items on the left for overviews of the wonderful toys you can play with here.

## Project Links

You have two ways of viewing the files in the Jaanga repositories:  

* Code hosted on GitHub: [jaanga.github.io]( http://jaanga.github.io/home/r2/index.html "view the files as apps." )  <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  
* Source code on GitHub: [github.com/jaanga]( https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/blob/master/overview-jaanga.md "View the files as source code." )  <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>

## Notes

### docBrowser ~ the file menu and display app
The library used to display these pages is under heavy development. See: [docBrowser]( https://github.com/jaanga/libs/tree/gh-pages/db/ "Your GitHub hosted pages buddy" ) 
	
### System Requirements	
The code on Jaanga makes extensive use of the latest and most demanding Internet technologies 
- including [WebGL]( http://get.webgl.org/ "Thank you Khronos Group!") and HTML 5. 
Unless you are on a recently-built computer with a multi-core CPU and GPU and using the latest version of the Chrome, Opera or Firefox browsers, 
you will not a great experience here. In some instances, you may be able to use Safari or Internet Explorer 11 but this is not predictable or likely - yet. 
		
### The Name
The name 'Jaanga' was chosen because it sounds jazzy, it is short and search results indicate uniqueness.
