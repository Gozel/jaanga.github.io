## Organization

Jaanga is a [GitHub]( http://github.com) [organization account]( https://help.github.com/articles/what-s-the-difference-between-user-and-organization-accounts ) and has multiple owners and admins. 
All Jaanga scripts are [FOSS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ).


All Jaanga work is designed to be visible both as [source code]( https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/blob/master/request-jaanga-blog-posts.html "an example" ) 
and as apps or documents using the GitHub [Pages]( https://pages.github.com/ ) feature.
In other words, Jaanga uses GitHub both as a software repository and as a web host server. Thank you GitHub!

Most pages have a toggle button or link at the top of the page that allows you to switch from one view to the other view.

Many of the apps have read me pages that enable you to edit, update and save the app.

If you see something you like, it's easy for you to take it, make it your own, improve it an share your results with the world.


The name 'Jaanga' was chosen because it sounds jazzy, it is short and search results indicate uniqueness.
This is because Jaanga is about writing software that is fun, easy and gets things done.
