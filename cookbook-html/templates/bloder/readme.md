### Template

* [request-posts-template.html]( request-posts-template.html )

### Users

* [Jaanga Blog]( http://jaanga.github.io/request-jaanga-blog-posts.html )
* [Outer Space Blog]( http://jaanga.github.io/outer-space/get-posts.html )
* [Gestification Blog]( http://jaanga.github.io/gestification-r2/request-gestification-blog-posts.html )


## Things to Do / Road Map

* Add links to blog tags
* Enable multiple tags in post titles
* load Showdown from bloder
	* Or will this slow things down
	* Note: Showdown has frequent updates
* Add copyright notice

### Big Picture

* Add a special font, colors, zippier layout?
* Think of using GitHub gists as an alternative
	* Inbuilt comments
	* Inbuilt Markdown interpreter
	* Good API support
* But Gists are tied to people not organizations maybe

### Reminders

* Add links to dev notes where appropriate, from blogs?
