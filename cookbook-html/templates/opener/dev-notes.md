## Mission

* Index file deals with multiple file types
	*.JS and .MD today. HTML on the way
* Opens a .JS script or .MD markdown file as default or an HTML file as default
	* Set default file using variable
* Using`hashchange` event and location.hash, opens .JS, .MD or .HTML files
* Markdown is translated to HTML and centered on screen
* Loads any required scripts
* Separate HTML and JavaScript files
	* Can use JS hint
	* On-the-fly HTML and CSS appears more natural. May cause fewer WTF
* Small, simple and fairly easy to understand
