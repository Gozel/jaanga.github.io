Jaanga Manifesto
===

Efforts are ways of using your knowledge

All efforts herein are owned by you out there

Code is a way of sharing effort

All code here intended forked, edit and shared

In all manner of ways

Mostly with good manners we hope


'Stay the course' or 'disrupt the disruption?

'Robert's Rules of Order' or 'The Little Red Book'?

'Consistency is the bugaboo of little minds' or 'A building should be firm, commodious and delightful'?
