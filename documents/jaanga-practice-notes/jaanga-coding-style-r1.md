## Coding Style & URL Naming Guidelines


The code should be as close as possible to readable - or even spoken - English. 
In other words it's great if you can read the code out load and it mean something.

The coding style of an app should follow the style of the most-used library of the app.
An the style of an app built with jQuery should follow the style of, say, the [jQuery API Documentation]( http://api.jquery.com/ ). 
The style of an app built using Three.js should follow the style of, say, the [Three.js Examples]( http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/ ).
The styles in both the above examples do tend to be fairly simple coding styles - which is great for our kinds of uses.
On occasion a greater degree of complexity is required In that case then the source code of each library should be used as it respective style to follow.


_What the following needs, more than anything, is links to sources that justify the following statement.
This documents should not be the ideas popping out of an individuals head, but the result of a number of long term investigations.
In other words, this document is not anecdotal but based on clinical studies. 
The following should a demonstration based on the [scientific method]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method )._

* Code generally follows the [Three.js examples]( http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/ ) coding style
	* In the instance of a [Three.js]( http://threejs.org ) script, the style generally follows [Mr.doob Coding Style]( https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Mr.doob%27s-Code-Style%E2%84%A2 ).
	* Three.js source code style is used as a secondary reference
	* Descriptive, informative variable names
	* Functions are functions not variables
	* Uses init() and animate() functions
	* Loads libraries from GitHub via a CDN
	* No external js or css files other then standard Three.js files
	* You should be able to move from reading Mr.doob's examples to reading Jaanga examples with little or no hesitation
	* In other words, code for youngsters/oldsters/beginners
* Lots of white space
	* Good: x = 23 * y + 54 * z
	* Not so good: x=23*y+54*z
	* Remember: JavaScript is compiled on the fly: no longer need to worry about whitespace slowing things down
* Minimum notation or use of symbols
	* Good: y = Math.floor( x );
	* Not so good: y = ~~x;
	* We do use semi-colons at the end of statements. The semicolon feels like the period at the end of a sentence. It allows you take take a breath before continuing
		* But otherwise minimize the use of punctuation because punctuation tends to slow down the reading speed
* All lower case
	* Even !DOCTYPE
* Everything in one file
	* No need to have multiple files open 
	* No need to keep looking all over the place 
* Emphasis on the use of one tool: JavaScript
	* The Document Object Model(DOM) is your friend
	* Use the DOM to add HTML and CSS to the document on the fly
* Very limited usage of libraries
	* No need to know Three.js and jQuery and whatever before you begin
	* Knowing some JavaScript and something about a single library should be good enough in most instances
* Lots of small apps
	* Not one big app
* Emphasis on astronomy, physics, math but not coding
	* We seek great visualizations not great code
	* The code is not there to impress programmers or to show off programming skills
		* Unless that skill is about making code simpler and easier to digest
	* The code must be easy to read so that the physics, math, engineering or whatever stands out not the techie bits
	* Typically you are looking at two screens or windows - one showing the simulation and the other showing the code
		* The task is to reduce the multi-tasking to a minimum
* Sharing is of the essence
	* Fork, edit/improve, share is the mantra
	* GitHub is the platform

Absolute URLs are recommended for items that would otherwise have issues with loading into Code-Edit-View.

Everything in Jaanga is written in client-side JavaScript.


### Various Other Coding Quirks

* CSS tags are in alphabetical order
* Latitude and longitude are always specified in this order
	* lat = 2 * x
	* lon = 3 * y
* X and y are always specified in this order
	* x = lon - 10;
	* y = lat + 5;
* Width and height are always specified in this order 
	* width = lon / 2
	* height = lat / 3
* Separation of 3D in-world code and 2D user interface code
	* All interaction with the Three.js code for 3D interaction is via embedded iframes
	* Allows parent window to use any of the many popular JavaScript libraries
	* Makes no attempt to turn Three.js code into, say, jQuery and ditto _vice versa_
* Takes as much advantage of the HTML 5 [Document Object Model (DOM)]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model ) as possible
	* Example: `<tag id=thing >stuff</tag>`
		* 'thing' is taken as a global variable directly and immediately
		* `document.getElemenById is never invoked
	* Implies no support for elderly browsers
		* OK since WebGL cannot run in elderly browsers
		* Follows the Mr.doob ethos of no nostalgia, remain calm and progress into the future ASAP
* Code here is highly-risk taking
	* Example: Double quotes only used when absolutely necessary
		* The world: <html lang="en">
		* Us: <html lang=en >
	* Example: plays happily, willfully with untyped variables 
	* Example: see above / no support for elderly browsers
* Code is designed to load or render on demand
	* In other words to load and display something ASAP
	* 'Just-in-time' library and data loading
* Code style
	* Generally follows '[MDCS]( https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Mr.doob's-Code-Style%E2%84%A2 )'
	* As generous horizontally but much more greedy vertically
	* Also passes jsHint
* Code is designed to be seriously easy
	* Encourages engineers, architects and designers and non-professional programmers to add features
	* No need to know jQuery, Backbone, Angular. Get going if you only know a tiny bit of JavaScript
	* And do feel free to build a jQuery version...
* Content, appearance and behavior that are related are kept together
	* Every HTML file contains all its associated CSS, HTML data - as well as the JavaScript
		* The use of external JavaScript files other than major libraries such as Three.js or Showdown is kept to a minimum
	* No need to keep three files open. It's all in one file just in front of you
	* This is part of techniques that help you become more accustomed to the DOM
	* You should be able to download the single file and it runs
		* Links to essential libraries are absolute URLs
* Functions are still declared in old school manner
	* We use: function name(){}
	* We use rarely: var name = function(){}
	* This is because most people still seem to be learning JavaScript this way
	* When we find a good reason to switch, then we will switch
	* Example: if the Three.js examples switch over, then we switch over
* Functions contain most everything they need to run
	* You should be able to copy a function to another script and it should work
	* All little things such as var pi = Math.PI can be at the top of the function
	* We like: var thing; thing = []; because this allows the var statement to be commented out so it becomes a global and easier to debug
	* We like: var v = function( x, y, z ){ return new THREE.Vector3( x, y, z ); };
		* Yes, this is an instance of a function being declared as a variable
		* As a variable declaration it can be placed at the top of a function add thus advertises its usage later on
			* It's like the [gun on the mantle piece in a play]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun )
		* This makes sense for one-liners only


## URL Naming Conventions

Use suggestions such as those provided in the following articles for naming repositories, folders and files

* [11 Best Practices for URLs]( https://moz.com/blog/11-best-practices-for-urls )

In other words

* all-lower-case-with-hyphens-between-words.got-it
