CS 482
===

[CS 482/681: Simulations in Computer Graphics]( https://www.cs.uaf.edu/courses/cs482/2015-spring/ ) is a computer science course offered by the College of Engineering and Mines
at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The course is taught by [Dr Orion Lawlor]( https://www.cs.uaf.edu/faculty/lawlor/).

The course uses WebGL and Three.js to create computer simulations for a variety of STEM topics.

It is the most concise yet far-ranging introduction to STEM simulations that we know of.

The mission of this document is to help make the syllabus even more accessible.

Topic covered include include:
