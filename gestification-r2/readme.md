## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Patttern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

The [Leap Motion]( http://leapmotion.com ) device is a wonderful, natural addition to the user experience of computers.
Many excellent apps are available for the device and the set of tool to build new apps gets more powerful and more sophisticated with each release.

On the other hand:

* Having a 'look-see' at the code takes quite a while. It can take days to get going.
* Because the code is highly sophisticated and built for full-stack developers, access by less skilled coders is less easy.
* Bashing out a quick demo turns out taking more time than you want because the developer tools are feature rich and the feature gods must be satiated before you code. ;-) 

### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* To provide scripts you can learn how to do Leap-ish things in a few hours
* To allow you to build Leap demos in minutes


### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

## The Scripts
