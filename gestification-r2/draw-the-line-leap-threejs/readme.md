## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

-->

People have been drawing for thousands of year, but always by having to hold tools in their hands - and by having to press against a flat surface.
Are there no new ways of drawing?


### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* To draw in 3D using your fingers and export the data into a DXF file

### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->


## Things to Do / Road Map

* Begin to consider methods of turning the data into 2D

## Features

* Draws a line in 3D using the motion of your index finger
* Start and finish drawing using your hand
* Capture the Leap data, export and save to a DXF file
* Update the screen in 3D
	* 1 finger / left button =  rotate
	* 2 finger / wheel = zoom in and out
	* 3 finger / right button = pan


## Issues

* Code is very r1. Needs a clean up
