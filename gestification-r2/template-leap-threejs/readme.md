## Concept

### The Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

-->

* It's not easy enough to see how easy it is to program for the Leap Motion device
* Much of the great available material requires that you are already a full-stack developer, there's not much for the newbs
* Most programmers know at least a bit about JavaScript, but not many C++ coders may know jQuery and few Python peeps may know CoffeeScript. 
Scripts written in JavaScript derivatives are not always readable by large groups of programmers

### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* To create small, fast and easy Leap Three.js JavaScript boilerplate templates
* To create a variety of Leap templates that suit a variety of needs
* To write code that almost all programmers can read quite easily

### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->
