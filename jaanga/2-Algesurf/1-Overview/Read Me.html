<p>Welcome to the visual beauty of mathematics.</p>

<p>Do you ever look at a math equation and ask yourself: "What does thing I am looking at actually look like?"</p>

<p>[TBD: equation here. new equation appears every five seconds]</p>

<p>Well, you have come the right place. Here's what the equation looks like:</p>

<p>[TBD: output of the visualizations]</p>
