_Earth Globe Displacement Map_


## Concept

The earth is covered in oceans and mountains, some places are bumpy and others are smooth.
We need to be able to see and feel this lumpiness

### Mission

* Good looking, well detailed globes
* Fast loading
* Very reusable, embeddable
* Simple code that gets you going fast


### Vision

* A new type of 3D gazetteer

## Features

* Three quite different coding examples
	* Two based on scaling vertices
	* One based on the Three.js displacement shader

## Wish list

* Show some demos here
