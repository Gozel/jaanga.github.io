Tween.js Turns Tweening and Animating in 3D into a Joy

In our OpenDesk, OpenHouse and new Moving Manuals projects, we are very concerned about showing you how to assemble a bunch of components into a finished product.
The idea is to show the compoments as they are cut out of a sheet or taken out of the box and watch them move into their final position.
The trypical graphics library enables you to move and rotate objects in real-time from one location to another.
But in creating as assembly animation, we want to slowthe process down. We want to see the compoents moving gently from the floor t assembly one by one.

The script we are using is [Tween.js]( https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js ). Three.js examples that use Tween.js have been part of Three.js for several years.
Tween.js has too many features to decribe here. But one of great concern is which, easing to use when.
