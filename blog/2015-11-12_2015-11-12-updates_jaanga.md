## Gimbal Lock

We built a demo that displays [Gimbal Lock]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock ) issues.

[Gimbal Lock LookAt]( http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook-threejs/functions//gimbal-lock/gimbal-lock-lookat-r1.html )

Use the sliders to move the box around the north pole. Watch the box spin.

This is a first step in looking for simple ways to overcome gimbal lock issues. 
All of this will help with developing scripts for the Leap [Gestification r2]( http://jaanga.github.io/gestification-r2/ ) project.

## Jaanga Blog Progress

Bloder R2 is going well.

The GitHub Pages feature along with the GitHub API turns coding a simple blog a very simple task.
