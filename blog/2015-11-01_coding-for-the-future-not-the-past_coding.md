Coding for the Future, not the Past
===

ES 6 is starting to work in many browsers, but not all - and does not work at all in older versions of all browsers.
What is ES6? It is the latest revision of JavaScript. 
It adds a ton of new features. In particular it adds a number of things to make it simpler, easier and faster to write scripts.
The question, therefore, is should we use these new features or should we wait until everybody in on new browsers?
Well, given that some people will choose to use Internet Explorer 6 until they die, that cold be a long wait.
In any case, many of the issues that are sent in relatte to 'It doesn't work in such-and-such browser!'
The dilemma then is do we code for the future or code to support the past.

Here is our take in this matter.
Any web site that sees to attract a mass market of users must code in such a way as to support as many browsers as possible.
The code may be slow and complex and huge but the users will be able to view the content.
This work method is the obvious common practice as most web sites are looking for as many users as possible.

This web site has a different objective. Our objective is to help you improve your expertise in your area of interest by manipulating its data.
The code we show you must be fast simple and easy. 
If new tricks come along to help that objective, then use them as soon as possible.

OK. once your script are running well and you are looking to seek wider usage of your work then you may start to code more defensively.
But in the mean time you can follow this advice.
As [Arther C Clarke's Three Laws]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws ) number two says: The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
