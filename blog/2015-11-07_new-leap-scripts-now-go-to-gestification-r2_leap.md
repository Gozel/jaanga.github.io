New Leap Scripts Now Go To Gestification R2
===


Jaanga has had scripts for the [Leap Motion]( http://leapmotion.com ) from since before the device was released to the public.

During that time - because the device is a breakthrough device - Jaanga made an attempt to create break through interfaces.

See [Jaanga Gestification]( http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/index.html )

These interfaces have all been too much to maintain.

So now we going off to a simpler interface.

With several new scripts

* draw-the-line-leap-threejs
* flick-to-select-leap-threejs
* object-to-object-raycasting-leap-threejs
* template-leap-threejs

See [Jaanga Gestification R2]( http://jaanga.github.io/gestification-r2/index.html )
