In an earlier post, [Tween.js Turns Tweening and Animating in 3D into a Joy]( http://jaanga.github.io/request-jaanga-blog-posts.html#2016-01-15_tweenjs-makes-tweening-in-3d-a-joy_moving-manuals.md),
we talked about a script that shows all the possible easings in Tween.js available in a single tween event.
Another important aspect in tweeing is how to link meultople tweens.

We are in the process of building up our knowledge of tweening and, if course, we keep our knowledge in a JavaScript file.
