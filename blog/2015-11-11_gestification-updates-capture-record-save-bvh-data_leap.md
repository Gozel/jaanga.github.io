Gestification Updates - Capture, Record Save BVH Data
===


BVH is a wonderful way to save motion data. It's fast, simple and moderately easy to understand.

We made a big effort in 2013 to build a set of scripts that capture real-time Leap motion data, convert the data to BVH format 
and save the data to files.

We have now updated the files so that they work with the current version of Three.js and added them to the Gestification R2 portfolio.

The files are all in this folder:

* [jestHands]( http://jaanga.github.io/gestification-r2/jest-hands-leap-threejs/ )  

The files to capture and record Leap JSON data have still to be added.
