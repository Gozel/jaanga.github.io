Gestification Updates - Capture, Record Save BVH Data

## BVH Capture, Record and Save

[BVH]( http://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/cs-838-1999/Jeff/BVH.html ) is a wonderful - perhaps archaic - way to save motion data. It's fast, simple and moderately easy to understand.

We made a big effort in 2013 to build a set of scripts that capture real-time Leap motion data, convert the data to BVH format 
and save the data to files.

We have now updated the files so that they work with the current version of Three.js and added them to the Gestification R2 portfolio.

The files are all in this folder:

* [jestHands]( http://jaanga.github.io/gestification-r2/jest-hands-leap-threejs/ )  

The files to capture and record Leap JSON data have still to be added.

## Gestification Blog Started

This blog loads a subset of Jaanga blog posts that relate only to the Leap device and the Gestification project.

## Phalanges R8

In Gestification R1, the [Phalanges project]( http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/cookbook/phalanges/r7/phalanges.html ) mission was to: 

> Phalanges, using Leap.js, parses incoming Leap Motion data then, using Three.js, creates and updates 3D objects  that mirror the live motion of hands and fingers on screen in real-time. 

Phalanges R8 has been started and will continue the investigation.

The interesting thing is that two years later, both the tools and our knowledge have much increased. There should be a lot of fun new stuff happening here in the future.
