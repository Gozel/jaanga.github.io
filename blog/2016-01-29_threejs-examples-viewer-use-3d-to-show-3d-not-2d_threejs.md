Three.js Examples Viewers: Use 3D To Show 3D Not 2D

Many of of you are working really hard to bring 3D into the web as an everyday experience. 
And yet many of you continue to display 2D thumbnails in your portfolios of your 3D work.

But have you tried or even considered using 3D thumbnails?

The above example shows it is possible and workable to use 3D to show 3D. 
Embedded in this blog post, you have access to all 270 [Three.js examples]( http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/ ) files.
Admittedly the performance is barely acceptable. 
On the other hand as 14nm and 10 nm processors become ubiquitous the speed issues for files of this complexity will become trivial.

Benefits

* WYSIWYG



Scroll down this page to see examples - in iframes - of the practice of hiding 3D from the X3D, Babylon.js and Three.js web sites.

You and I know that there some extraordinary, dynamic, animated, delightful 3D web pages behind many of those flatland images.

But to the average human, this power might as well be hidden under a rock.

We are scaling many of the web page iframes.
The idea comes from: [Simulating Website Thumbnails using Iframes]( https://medium.com/@jamesfuthey/simulating-the-creation-of-website-thumbnail-screenshots-using-iframes-7145269891db )
In his post, James Futhey adds a container so that the iframe behaves as an IMG file and several other features.

We are not following these practices, because they would serve the pur[se of turning a 3D experience back into a 2D experience.
The issue with 3D is that as the cursor lands over an iframe and the iframe behavior takes control then this may stop or interrupt the process of scrolling the page
