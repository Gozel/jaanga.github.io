Comtinuing yhe work on upgrading the overall Jaanga user experiencce.

Yesterday the default reader-iframes was seriously updated. Ditto the carousel.

Code Edit View was forked over from Exploratoria. The code has been simplified and cleaned up. 
The view and edit panes placement switched. And buttons style simplified - no more gradient except for file open.

here were quite a few edits and additions to the home page read me nd to read me files elsewhere.
