Comtinuing the work on upgrading the overall Jaanga user experiencce.

Yesterday the default reader-iframes was seriously updated. Ditto the carousel.

Code Edit View was forked over from Exploratoria. The code has been simplified and cleaned up. 
The view and edit panes placement switched. 
Perhaps there should be a toggle that let's you choose which goes where.
And buttons style simplified - no more gradient except for file open.

The Code Edit View Feature was suggested by Paul M. 
It's a great way to show that web pages are code not magic.

Edits
There were quite a few edits and additions to the home page read me nd to read me files elsewhere.
Read Me cheat sheet and read me template files were created.
Basic-html.html move into its own folder and read me created.


In the process of moving the web page/source code view buttons to the top of the page.
Placing them above the breadcrumbs, makes them even more part of the navigation system.
This should make them less distracting and yet help you remember where they always are without having to think about it.
In turn this is part of the process to help you remember that a web page is not magic, a web page is code.

There are a number of housekeeping read me files. 
Files that sit between top menus and app menus with nothing but links and short descriptions
One day these files will be created by algorithm
And with the GitHub API this should not be a difficult task.

Copyright and license and read me stuff have been moved from the jope page into their own files.
Actually the files were already there, it's just the data was duplicated and the links were not there.

Generally the Jaanga home page is becoming a more simple experience for the user - and possibly becoming easier to maintain
As always, there could be many more words - and much more code.
