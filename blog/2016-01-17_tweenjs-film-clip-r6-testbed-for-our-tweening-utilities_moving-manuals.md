In an earlier post, [Tween.js Turns Tweening and Animating in 3D into a Joy]( http://jaanga.github.io/request-jaanga-blog-posts.html#2016-01-15_tweenjs-makes-tweening-in-3d-a-joy_moving-manuals.md),
we talked about a script that shows all the possible easings in Tween.js available in a single tween event.
Another important aspect in tweening is how to link multiple tweens.

We are in the process of building up our knowledge of tweening and, if course, we keep our knowledge in a JavaScript file.
And that knowledge is currently embedded in [tween-rX.js]( http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook-threejs/functions/tweening/js/tweenjs-r1.js }
So the demo you see above is a script that uses twwn-rX.js to generate multiple random tweens with multiple random easings.
We are using Tweenj.js Film Clips for designing, building and testing tweening demos.

Currently the motions are all quite random. Future releases might explore more orchestrated tweens.
