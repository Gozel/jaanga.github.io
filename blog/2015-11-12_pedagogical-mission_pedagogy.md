Pedagogical Mission
===

AbeM asked an excllent question abot Jaanga and its mission. 

	Do you have an idea of what an ideal collaboration might look like and where you'd like it to go?   

Here are some thoughts:

The issue is that it's not easy for peeps to acquire STEM skills.

The mission for 'Outer Space' and the Jaanga GitHub organization as a whole is to provide tantalizing teaching tools.

The first and most wonderful thing would be to help the 'first responders' - the actual peeps on the ground trying to do some teaching

'Your wishlist is my command line' is the operative motif here. If somebody approaches us with a defined 3D STEM pedagogical need then we must do our best to respond with demos and scripts and links.

The second task must be to add the meta-information to physical exhibits. For example, you build a Newton's Cradle at a museum workshop. When you get home, you go online and run a simulation that allows you to edit the size, elasticity and shape of the balls, the length of the string, the friction due to air, the pull of gravity and so on.

The third element must be to attract hackers and hobbyists to come on board and fork, edit and share their STEM simulations and experiments.
