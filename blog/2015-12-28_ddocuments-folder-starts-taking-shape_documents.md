Documents Folder Starts Taking Shape
===

The new Jaanga Documents folder is the place in which we 'duck yer c'ments' regarding how little we actually know.

It may also be seen as a venue for a cornucopia of curated codifications/catastrophes/crap or whatever.

The mission is to be a curated portal into the development of 3D web apps mostly devoted to STEM.

It's about helping with what we term: just-in-time learning.

The 'just-in-time' portion is loosely derived from [just-in-time manufacturing]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing ).

The 'learning' portion relates to the acquisition of some knowledge in a manner that is different than becoming educated or about being taught.

Gaining an education and being taught are highly open ended activities.
One learns many things so as to be able to reuse portions of that knowledge in future tasks.

Just-in-time learning is about learning what you need to learn in order to accomplish the task at hand.

The methodology we use often starts with a Google search leading to

* Wikipedia
* StackOverflow
* Blog posts

A second method involves perusing collections of examples as published in books and course that are available online

* Three.js Examples
* Skemoski
* Dirksen
* Parisi
* Lawlor

A third method includes looking the documentation

* Three.js Documentation
* Mozilla Developer Network
* W3Schools 


A fourth method is reviewing the blog posts of noted developers

* Altered Qualia
* ZZ85
* Moxie
* Sanchez 
* Callum
* And many more

The result is that it is just about inevitable that somebody has already written the code you need for the task at hand.
You need to learn on what us needed t edit or modify the code for your current purpose.

The purpose of the Jaanga Documentation folder is to be

* A portal of portals
	* links to the books and blogs and docs we like
	* A curated list of thing we like and find of interest in all of the above
* An experiment in online information delivery
	* You don't go to the information
	* The information comes to you
* A continuation of the 'write once, read many' tactics being implemented throughout Jaanga
	* View the code as source code
	* View the code running as a demo
	* View the code's back story
