Bloder R3 Adds Next and Previous Buttons
==

The following Jaanga blogs have been updated to call the [Bloder R3]( http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook-html/templates/bloder/ ) script

* [Bloder]( http://jaanga.github.io/blog/request-posts-template.html )
* [Jaanga Blog]( http://jaanga.github.io/request-jaanga-blog-posts.html )
* [Outer Space Blog]( http://jaanga.github.io/outer-space/get-posts.html )
* [Gestification Blog]( http://jaanga.github.io/gestification-r2/request-gestification-blog-posts.html )

As we have said before, building a blog script is easy - and fun.

This revision add next and previous buttons. 
A nice feature is that when you get to the earliest post, the next button rewinds back up to the latest post.
The reverse is true with the previous button.

A new footer variable makes it easier to customize footers. 
The default footer has next and previous buttons as well as a link to the Jaanga copyright and license page.

In updating the various blogs, we have started adding fun [unicode emoji]( http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html ) wherever.
