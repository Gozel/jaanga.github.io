Leap Keypad: Flick to Select
===

In anither forum @zachinster and I have been having an interesting Leap discussion.
We have been talking about building Leap apps that resmble playing the guitar.

This discussion arose because of his [3D Jam]( https://developer.leapmotion.com/3djam) submission titled [VR Guitar]( http://itch.io/jam/leapmotion3djam/rate/39736 ).

One part of the discussion has focused on selecting and playing chords on a guitar.
Though I am not a guitar player, the topic is interesting.

Below is a typical chord diagram. It shows which of your five fingers - in columns - show cover which of the six strings. 
The 'o' indicates that you should cover a second string with the one finger.

Db
```
e -x-|---|---|---|---|
B ---|-x-|---|---|---|
G -x-|---|---|---|---|
D ---|---|-x-|---|---|
A ---|---|---|-x-|---|
E ---|---|---|-o-|---|
```

So there are thirty 'things' to touch with your fingers.
The question is: how do you do the same thing with a Leap device?

Other ways of posing the question:

Given five columns of radio buttons with six buttons in each column, can you use the Leap device to press the correct buttons in all five columns all at once.

Given thirty keys to push, can you press them in the correct pattern in a Leap simulation.

I have started investigating this idea. Here is a screen capture of what I have so far:
