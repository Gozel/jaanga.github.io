Lots of good work on the project that is still in quiet mode.

[Multiple Iframes via GitHub API ]( http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook-threejs/viewers/multiple-iframes/multiple-iframes-via-github-api/index.html )

* Adds no zooming inside any of the iframes while mouse over or using the scroll wheel to scroll the page
	* Enables you to scroll up and down the page without interruption
* This file and it successors should be my base template for subsequent effort

Many more features to be added in the future
