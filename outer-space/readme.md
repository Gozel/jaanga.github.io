## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Patttern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

Access to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ([STEM]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_Technology,_Engineering,_and_Mathematics ))

* People do not always find it an easy thing trying to acquire skills in science, technology, engineering and math.

<!-- Theo 2015-10-21 >> I'm looking for links that describe the types of issues that people may have in acquiring STEM skills -->
 
Access to Data

* The tools to explore and discover things were once literally rocket science. Yet we know that the data is accessible and and the development tools easier than ever. 
* Computers and the Internet have allowed scientists to gather, store and share huge amounts of data, yet that data is often in huge highly inaccessible files and to examine the data compl  

Access to Tools

* Typical samples of programming code relate to coding skills, while actual STEM applications tend to be huge and complex. 
Beginners have little access to good places to start.


### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->


STEM
* To proved software examples that only require a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to get going and 'make it your own'
* To demonstrate that all this is possible in an environment that allows you to fork, embellish, share and publish online that is free and open source


Access to Tools

* To provide real-world STEM tools that useful, informative and simple that you may fork, edit and share
* To supply a range of cookbook code samples only a few hundred lines long that beginners can learn in an afternoon and begin enhancing in a day or two.
* To follow established coding - not quirky - standards so that students coming in get up to speed quickly

_If you can change the orbit of a satellite and monitor the consequences, do you not then 'own' that satellite?
If you 'own' a thing - even if it's only in your imagination - have you not acquired a huge amount of knowledge?_



### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* To help you write code that helps you - and others - to discover new things about the the universe you live in
