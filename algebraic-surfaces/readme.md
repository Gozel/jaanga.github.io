### Change Log

2013-01-18 ~ Theo
* Added this change log
* Added parser.html/js: cookbook code for parsing equations using Silent Matt's parser
* Parser now embedded in display code and it works!
* All existing equations converted back to caret notation
* Code tidied and simplified - now single array of equations - player plays through all of them
* Added length of time delay input box. Tried to do same with spinSpeed but having issues
